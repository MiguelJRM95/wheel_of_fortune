The field that I decided to choose for develop my app is coaching
both life and profesional coaching.

I find this area of business is growing quite a lot lately, so I think
it's a good business.

Summary of Life Coaching Statistics:
    71,000 life coaches based in 161 countries worldwide
    In 2018 there were 53,300 coaches
    Life coaching is the second fastest growing industry
    23,300 coaching practitioners in North America
    The percentage change in total revenue for coaches between 2015-2019 was 36%
    The estimated global revenue from coaching in 2019 was $2.849 billion

The life coaching field has increase a lot it's impact in the market, as the number of people wanting to be coached just keeps increasing. Coaches have become a commodity in our modern world, the demand for every type of life coach has literally skyrocketed. 

So this app comes to help that amount of people that want to be coached and need help, and also make this task easy connecting on
a direct way trhougth the email, and in a future update via real time chat.

An app like this can be the door for a lot of freelancer coaches that want the commodity just to log in and talk with their clients.
